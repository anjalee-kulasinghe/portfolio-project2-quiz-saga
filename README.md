## UX
There are two user groups targeted by this website. They are employers and the recruiters.
The site is focused on simplicity and ease of navigation for the user's main focus areas on my resume.

## User stories
As the sole developer of this website, my goal is to secure employment opportunities in the web development area as well as other potential employment in the area of IT.
I came up with the following points, which are applicable to the users:

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of this website quickly and easily.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate this website (by using a mouse, a keyboard, or a touch screen).
- As a user, I want to view this candidate's work and education history and skills.
- As a user, I want to know what technical languages and tools this candidate is able to work in, as well as the candidate's language proficiency.
- As a user, I want a way to contact this candidate.
- As a user, I want to get a copy of the candidate's traditional CV.

### Strategy
The goal is to make a well-functioning professional CV website. The focus was on making the design both user-friendly and creative.

### Scope
For the users (employers and recruiters), I wanted to give them a good overview of myself (Anjalee Kulasinghe), focusing on my experience, education, and skills. This way, the users can get a better idea of who I am and whether I am a potential candidate for the vacancy. As well, I kept the traditional CV format so it would be easy for the users to find information about me.

### Structure
I followed the traditional CV framework since it is not overly complicated and it will be easy for the users to find the information they are looking for. The Online CV website has a single, long, scrolling page design. My structure features a fixed top navigation that connects the user to each of the sections from anywhere on the page. I have also included a link at the end of the navigation to download a copy of the traditional CV if the user likes that format.

**Website Sections:**
1. **_Home / Landing page:_** A simple introduction about myself.
2. **_Experience:_** My work histories are displayed in reverse chronological order.
3. **_Education:_** My education history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
4. **_Skills:_** Four focus areas are divided into boxes, which include my professional skillset, language proficiency, technical languages, and technical tools that I am familiar with.
5. **_Contact:_** A contact page featuring basic contact information, and a contact form to contact me via the webpage.
6. **_Footer:_** This is not the main section of the website but rather an ending to the website with social media links and copywriting information.

### Skeleton
The website is designed to be clear and simple. And the site has a simple tree structure with hierarchical flows from top to bottom.

**Wireframe**
The wireframe is designed using Balsamiq software. The first draft was edited with the guidance of the mentor. Although the site was built as a single-page scrolling website, the wireframe was designed to focus on each and every section as a single page and connect them using the navigation.

### Surface
I have selected a plain color for the main background color. But I also used a background image with bubbles in two sections. I have started the Diploma in Fullstack Development at Code Institute, which is the beginning of a new chapter of my life. The bubble backgroundÂ represents the meaning of change and transformation. I have selected the color theme that goes with the background image I have selected.

## Technologies
1. HTML - To create a basic site
2. CSS - To create a nice, standout front-end and to give a great user experience
3. Balsamiq - To create a wireframe

## Features
### Existing Features
* **Navigation Bar**
  * The navigation bar is at the top of the page, and it is fixed to the top. The logo is in the left-hand corner of the navigation, and it links to the index.html page. 
  * The other navigation links on the website are to the right. Home, Experience, Education, Skills, and Contact connect to different sections of the same page. Download CV is a link embedded in a pdf that will download the traditional CV to the device on which the website is open.
  * The font color is in contrast with the navigation background color. The hover effect is used for navigation, so the user can know which page they are on. 
  * The different sections of the navigation are under the same heading as a traditional CV. Users can easily understand what information is contained in different sections.

* **Home**
  - As the background image, an image of me (Anjalee Kulasinghe) has been used. On top of the image, I have used a flat color overlay with opacity.
  - There is a brief introduction to Anjalee Kulasinghe (me) with a simple animation used to give a welcome to the site.

- **Skills**
  - In this section, information is focused on four categories.
  - _Expertise:_ skills that I have learned during the past few years by working in different industries and jobs. I believe that these top few skills that I have listed will help me as a developer in the field of IT.
  - _Language skills (human):_ these are the languages that I am able to use for communication (read, write, and speak).
  - _Tools:_ some technological tools that I am familiar with.
  - _Tech Languages:_ these are some tech languages that I have some basic understanding of and have started to learn deeper with the Code Institute.

- **Contact**
  - In the Contact Me section, give the user the main contact details that they can use to reach me (Anjalee Kulasinghe). This section is divided into two main sections.
  - On the left-hand side, there is a picture of me, which will help the user remember who I am if they see me in an interview. Below the profile image, my name (first and last names), what positions I am currently capable of, my email address, my mobile number and my postal address are listed. 
  - On the left-hand side, a form is given where the users will have the ability to contact me directly by entering their name and email address along with a message. The user will be asked to include their first name, last name, email, and message. The submit and reset buttons are placed at the end of the form.

![contact_section](./assets/readme-assets/Contact-section.PNG)

### Features Left to Implement
In the future, 
* I would like to add the Portfolio section to the online CV, where I can add links to the websites that I have designed, along with a link to Github. If an employer is interested in my work, they can go in and have a look.
* I would like to make the contact form functional.
* I would like to improve the performance of the website.


## Testing
* I tested the site, and it works in different web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
* On mobile devices, I tested the my site on a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with the Samsung browser and an iPhone SE with the Safari browser.
* I confirmed that the site is responsive and functions on different screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
* I confirmed that the navigation and the sections Home, Experience, Education, Skills, and Contact are readable and easy to understand.
* I confirmed that the form works: it requires entries in every field, only accepts an email in the email field, and both the submit and reset buttons work.
* I confirmed that the Download CV link will download the pdf copy of the traditional CV to the device on which the site is open.

### Validator Testing
* **HTML**
  No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](./assets/readme-assets/validator_result_html.PNG)

* **CSS**
  No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](./assets/readme-assets/css-validator_result.PNG)
  
* **Accessibility**
  I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through [Lighthouse DevTools](./assets/readme-assets/site_accessibility.PNG)

### Bugs
* **Solved bugs**
  * When I deployed my project to GitHub pages, I found that my project was broken; the links to the other files (CSS and images) did not work.
  * My mentor showed me this had happened since I have used the file paths in the following way:
        `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/style.css">` 
  * Adding a '.' to the start of the file path fixed the problem.
        `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">`

  * When I was fixing my site to be responsive, I found out that in the 'Contact Me' section, the contact form does not go below the screen when the screen is small. 
  * This has happened since I have used `<display: flex;>`. 
  * Changing flex to block fixed the problem `<display: block;>`.
  
  
* **Unfixed Bugs**

When I checked my site on a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with the Samsung browser, I found out that the navigation was not responsive properly. Even though the navigation is fixed to the top, it is sometimes hidden in the address bar. I have to pull it down when I need to use the navigation bar.


## Deployment
* The site was deployed to Git Hub pages using the following steps:
  * In the Github repository, the Stetting tab.
  * Under General, navigate to Code and Automation and select 'Pages'.
  * In the Build and Deployment section for Source, select 'Deploy from a branch' from the drop-down list.
  * For Branch, select 'main' from the drop-down list and Save.
  * On the top of the page, the link to the complete website is provided.
  
  - The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
